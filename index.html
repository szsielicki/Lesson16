                work
                in HTML and CSS, our craft is built upon the foundation created by letterers, printers, typographers,

            <h3> The Lindisfarne Gospels</h3><br>


            <p>Through April 16, 2017<br>
                Harrington Hall</p>


            <p>The Lindisfarne Gospels is an illuminated manuscript, its pages filled with examples of elaborately and
                skillfully hand-rendered patterns and decorations. Produced sometime between 710 and 721, in a monastery
                off
                the coast of Northumberland at Lindisfarne, the manuscript is thought to be the work of a single scribe.
                With the original on display in the British Library in London, this travelling exhibit features a
                facsimile
                of the original. It is accompanied by poster-sized, high resolution photographic prints of some of the
                most
                intricate, ornate (original) pages.</p>

            <h3>Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</h3><br>

            <p>Opening January 28, 2017<br>
                Carnegie Gallery</p>

            <p>An Italian poet, editor, art theorist, fascist, and founder of the Futurist movement, Marinetti declared
                in
                his manifesto: “Courage, audacity, and revolt will be the essential elements of our poetry… We will
                destroy
                the museums, libraries, academies of every kind… We affirm that the world’s magnificence has been
                enriched
                by a new beauty: the beauty of speed.” He promoted a new kind of poetry, enhancing the expressive power
                of
                his writing with a loose construction of words. Influenced by his experience as a reporter in the Balkan
                conflict in 1912–13, much of Marinetti’s work conveyed something of the emotional tone or sensation of
                war.</p>
